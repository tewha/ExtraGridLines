ExtraGridLines
==============

**I have a fix for this that I will check in shortly as a new branch, *fixed*.**

This code demonstrates a bug in my code (I believe) that I need to fix.

1. Run the attached project. (The bug occurs with the simulator or hardware .)
2. Tap the search bar and type "a".
3. Drag the table.

When you drag, the keyboard will disappear, and you'll see double grid lines. The grid lines are what I'm trying to figure out.
